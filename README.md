# Prework STudy Guide Webpage

## Description

The page acts as a study guide for students completing the bootcamp’s prework modules. There are basic notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage provides a singular page for notes that may be useful when completing the prework project and can provide reminders of what is learnt elsewhere while completing the project. Hopefully, it highlights key information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage is intended to provide one place for all notes to be stored and to demonstrate the content noted at the same time. 

Producing this webpage helped me learn what is noted on the webpage but also how to put this information into action - to produce a basic HTML file, how to add CSS, the basics of JavaScript (including data types, functions, arrays and conditionals), and how to add interactivity to a webpage using the console in Chrome DevTools. It also provided the opportunity to practice creating feature branches and opening and merging pull requests on GibHub. It also involved learning to be patient while learning how to debug!

## Usage

Each section of this webpage contains information about certain topics, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

To open the DevTools on Google Chrome, right click on the webpage and select ‘Inspect’. Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut. For macOS you can use the following keyboard shortcut: Command+Option+I. For Windows users, you can use Control+Shift+I. Then, switch to the ‘Console’ tab. This will show you which topics are learned through the Prework. You can also see it tells you which topic we should study first. By refreshing the page, you should see the topic change, so it will also choose a topic to be studied second, third and fourth.
