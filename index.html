        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML = Hypertext Markup Language </li>
          <li>HTML is one of three cornerstone languages used in web development. It is used to create the structure of a webpage. </li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements - the type of content on a webpage that can be seen by the user. Elements are also used to divide the content and describe the content to browsers and other developers. Typically these elements will not be visible to the user. </li>
          <li>Elements use an opening and closing tag, represented by angle brackets. </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. Semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Using semantic HTML elements is important because they make the code easier to read. It also ensures the webpage is accessible to a wider variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies. </li>
          <li>Non semantic elements do not tell us about the content they contain. Non semantic elements are still used when they are the best solution to a structural issue. </li>
          <li>A footer element appears at the bottom of the webpage and normally contains information about the author, copyright, contact information, a sitemap of navigation information. </li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. An element hosting child elements is known as the parent element. </li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about the element. </li>
          <li>To create headings we use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 tags. The content contained within the opening and closing tag is the heading. In an HTML file, we can only use h1 once. </li>
          <li>We can use ul, ol and li elements to create unordered lists, ordered lists and list items. </li>
          <li>We use the img element for images that will be displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes, including the src attribute. The src attitude defines the location of the image. </li>
          <li>To set a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content we use a br element. </li>
          <li>We can use an anchor element (shown as an <a> to create links within the same webpage or to other webpages. A href attribute points us to the URL for the link. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheets.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is when a developer styles an element directly in the head section of the HTML file. Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible than using internal and external CSS style sheets.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet: an internal style sheet contains the CSS rules for the webpage using a style element in the head section of the HTML file. The CSS rules in this section will only apply to that webpage. Multiple elements on the webpage can be styled using CSS classes and IDs.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: CSS rules are coded in a separate file. A link to the external style sheet is placed using a link element in the HTML’s head section. This is normally the preferred method of styling HTML documents because design changes are easier to make.</li>
          <li>Using an external CSS style sheet is an example of how we follow the principle of the separation of concerns. The separation of concerns is based on the idea that we should divide code into different files based on its use.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</li>
          <li>A selector points to the HTML element you want to style. We can combine multiple selectors into a singe CSS rule using a comma. This is a way we can write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li> 
          <li>A declaration block contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply (e.g. colour) and the value of that property (e.g. blue). We surround declaration blocks with curly braces.</li>
          <li>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: a box wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element and the border.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>DRY code: the idea that developers can reduce the amount of code that is written by reusing or sharing pieces of code. This reduces the overall size and the complexity of the code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently working on </li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it </li>
          <li>git add -A: adds changed files in our working directory to the ‘staging’ area of git</li>
          <li>git commit -m “what has been changed”: committing the staged changes to our git repository </li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a website. JavaScript adds interactivity to a static HTML/CSS webpage. </li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is read from top to bottom so the order of code matters!</li> 
          <li>We declare a variable with the keyword ‘var’, e.g. </li>
          <li>Variables can have different data types, such as string, number, and boolean.</li>
          <li>String: a sequence of text. We show the value is a string by enclosing it in single quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number: numbers do not have quote marks.</li>
          <li>Boolean: a true or false value. The words true and false are considered special keywords, so we do not enclose them in quote marks.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data - normally the data will be related in some way.</li>
          <li>However, arrays are not limited to only hold a single type of data. Arrays can store multiple items with different types of data.</li>
          <li>We can declare an array the same way we declared a variable with only one data item: by using the keyword var e.g. var topics = [ ‘HTML’, ‘CSS’, ‘Git’, ‘JavaScript’];</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to use the location of the data item. Arrays are zero-indexed (meaning the indices will start at 0), are always whole numbers and increase by 1 each time (0, 1, 2, 3).</li>
          <li>Developers can instruct a programme to deviate from the normal flow of an application if certain conditions are met through the use of conditionals, e.g. ‘if statements’ and ‘if…else statements’.</li>
          <li>An ‘if statement’ introduces decision-making into our code. The code will execute if the statement meets a condition: if the statement is true (or truthy). If the condition is not true, or has a value that is false (falsy), the computer will ignore the action and move on.</li>
          <li>We use loops (e.g. a ‘for’ loop) as a way to instruct the computer to execute a single block of code multiple times.</li>
          <li>A ‘for’ loop instructs the computer to repeatedly perform a task on all single items in an array.  The code will run repeatedly, each time with a different value.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different than a loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute.</li>
          <li>A Java Script function must first be defined, and then must be called for the task or instructions to be performed.</li>
          <li>We use the function keyword to set a name for the function. We then use the code block (or the function body) in curly brackets, so we know what action will be performed when we call a function.</li>
          <li>To call a function, we write the function name, followed by parenthesis and a semicolon, e.g. makeTea();</li>
