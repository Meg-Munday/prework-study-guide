        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML = Hypertext Markup Language </li>
          <li>HTML is one of three cornerstone languages used in web development. It is used to create the structure of a webpage. </li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements - the type of content on a webpage that can be seen by the user. Elements are also used to divide the content and describe the content to browsers and other developers. Typically these elements will not be visible to the user. </li>
          <li>Elements use an opening and closing tag, represented by angle brackets. </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. Semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Using semantic HTML elements is important because they make the code easier to read. It also ensures the webpage is accessible to a wider variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies. </li>
          <li>Non semantic elements do not tell us about the content they contain. Non semantic elements are still used when they are the best solution to a structural issue. </li>
          <li>A footer element appears at the bottom of the webpage and normally contains information about the author, copyright, contact information, a sitemap of navigation information. </li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. An element hosting child elements is known as the parent element. </li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about the element. </li>
          <li>To create headings we use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 tags. The content contained within the opening and closing tag is the heading. In an HTML file, we can only use h1 once. </li>
          <li>We can use ul, ol and li elements to create unordered lists, ordered lists and list items. </li>
          <li>We use the img element for images that will be displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes, including the src attribute. The src attitude defines the location of the image. </li>
          <li>To set a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content we use a br element. </li>
          <li>We can use an anchor element (shown as an <a> to create links within the same webpage or to other webpages. A href attribute points us to the URL for the link. </li>
        </ul>
